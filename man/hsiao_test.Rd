\title{Classical Hsiao Homogeneity Test for Panel Data}
\usage{
hsiao_test(data, dep_var, indep_vars, id_var, time_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the panel data.}

\item{dep_var}{Character string. Name of the dependent variable.}

\item{indep_vars}{Character vector. Names of the independent variables.}

\item{id_var}{Character string. Name of the individual (panel) identifier.}

\item{time_var}{Character string. Name of the time variable (optional, not used in the test).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the test names, F-statistics, p-values, degrees of freedom, and decision results.
}
\description{
This function implements a set of F-tests proposed by Hsiao (1986) to check for heterogeneity in panel data models.
It tests whether intercepts and slopes are constant across cross-sectional units (e.g., countries, firms).
}
\details{
Conducts Hsiao's classical F-tests for homogeneity of intercepts and slopes across panel units.

Three nested linear models are estimated:
\itemize{
\item Model 1: Homogeneous intercepts and slopes
\item Model 2: Heterogeneous intercepts only
\item Model 3: Heterogeneous intercepts and slopes
}
Then, F-tests compare:
\enumerate{
\item Model 1 vs Model 3: tests both intercept and slope homogeneity
\item Model 2 vs Model 3: tests slope homogeneity
\item Model 1 vs Model 2: tests intercept homogeneity
}
