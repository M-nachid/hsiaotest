**Hsiao's Homogeneity Tests for Panel Data**

The `hsiaotest` R package provides classical and robust implementations of Hsiao's (1986) tests for panel data heterogeneity. These tests evaluate whether intercepts and/or slopes differ across cross-sectional units (e.g., countries, firms) using nested linear models and F-tests.
